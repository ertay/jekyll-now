Hi, there! I'm Ertay and I hope you will find the information on this blog interesting and helpful.

This blog mostly covers my journey in finding fun things to do as my vision deteriorates and I can't do some of the things that I could do before. If you are interested, check out the [introduction post](https://sightless.fun/An-Introduction) in this blog for a more detailed background.
