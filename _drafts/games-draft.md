## The First Video Game

My first introduction to video games was in 1994 when I was 4 and my father brought home a new gift that the whole family can enjoy - a Chinese clone of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Four year old me could only make sense of one item in the box - the dark grey plastic gun (that had a cord for some reason, unlike the other toy guns I had seen). 

While I was producing annoying 'pew pew' noises and pointing the plastic gun at my grandparents, my dad was fiddling with some cables and TV remote trying to do something with the TV. I can remember the TV had a lot of static sound (and now I know that he was using the tuner to find the channel that the console broadcasted on). Suddenly, a cartoony beach with a sunset in the background showed up on the TV. Plugging the plastic gun to the Nintendo, my father pressed a couple of buttons and the beach disappeared from the screen.

"Alright son, stop annoying grandpa and start pointing that gun at the ducks flying on the television." The first video game I ever played was [Duck Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt). Being a bird hunter himself, my grandpa was more excited than I was! The cartridge contained a few other games that we tried that day: Super Mario Bros, Arkanoid, Battle City, Excitebike, Othello, and possibly a couple others.

## The First Board Game

Board games did not have much of a special place in my early years, but we must do a small digression to briefly mention a couple of games. My memory in this area is somewhat fuzzy, but with high certainty I can narrow the games down to two. Those two games are _Backgammon_ and a variant of _[Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht)_ (which translates to 'Don't be angry buddy').

My grandpa introduced me to _Backgammon_ when I was either 7 or 8 years old. He really loved that game, and he enjoyed teaching it to me. Backgammon had a key role in the bonding with my grandfather. This game got a special part about 10 years later, during my final year in high school, when a group of classmates got addicted to the game.

Around the same time, I got to play a variant _Don't be angry buddy_ at my uncle's place with my cousins. In the variant we played, each player had 4 pawns, with each player starting in a separate corner. On a player's turn, a single die was rolled. If you rolled a 6, you got to move one pawn to the circular track on the board. Then, depending on your roll, you could move your pawn clockwise for to do a full lap and upon completing the lap. During the lap, if you landed on other players' pawns, they would have to put their pawns back to their starting positions - this is where the name of the game comes from (people got angry when you bumped their pawns back to the start!). Great fun for the whole family at that time!
